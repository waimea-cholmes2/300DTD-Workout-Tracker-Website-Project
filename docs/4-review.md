# Project Review

## Addressing Relevant Implications

### Functionality

To address the functionality implications I constantly tested my system, ensuring there was no bugs or errors, while also getting feedback from my end user, and using this testing and feedback to improve my site, so the outcome would be as my end user expected.


### Usability

To address the usability implications I made sure my site follows the common usability heuristics, such as User Control and Freedom, Visibility of System Status, Consistency and Standards, ETC. I ensured my system is logical and familiar by checking with my end user, so there is a clear path through the site, It is also clear what is happening to the user, because of the flash messages which show up after actions have been completed.


### Aesthetics

To address the aesthetics implications I constantly got feedback from my end-user to ensure the design appeals to them, while also following general aesthetics conventions, like having the title of a page be the largest text, then the subtitles then the paragraphs of text. I chose an aggressive colour scheme for my website, with black, red and gold, to fit within the idea of working hard at the gym.


### Accessibility

To address the accessibility implications I constantly got feedback from my end user to ensure that the site would be easy to maneuver for any possible users, I also used a colour scheme which helps buttons standout, like gold on black and black on red, to ensure they are easy to see, the site is also able to be used on a range of devices and browsers.


### End-User

To Address the End-user implications I ensured that my site will be usable on all devices, having a responsive UI which works on almost all sizes of device I did this through talking to my end-user, and learning about the differences in devices which other possible users may use on the site.


### Privacy

To address the privacy implications I made sure my site only collects data that is needed from the users, and the data is stored safely, where no other users can see or access it. I also inform the users about what data is required

## Overall Review

I was able to complete all sprints and provide an outcome which meets all the needs of my end-users. Talking to my end-user often made it easy to identify and fix any issues to help with the site's functionality or aesthetics so the site will be usable for the group of people I am trying to appeal to. Also due to regular testing being done, many bugs and errors were simple to fix. Some difficulties showed in designing the UI, struggling to identify and fix some problems with the layout of the site, as well as some issues which arose from differences in screen sizes. For example some items like the workouts table would remain too large when the screen shrank, meaning I needed to allow it to scroll. Testing and trialing the system constantly allowed me to ensure the final outcome is exactly what my end user wanted, mostly making small changes, like moving forms to separate pages, or placing the workouts table below the description of the exercise, to create a smoother experience for the end user. The constant testing also allowed me to not miss any bugs popping up in my code, meaning I didn't have to go combing through my code for the error commonly. If I could have done anything differently for this project I would have aimed to manage my time better, hoping to complete the earlier sprints in a faster fashion, to allow more time for the refinement, regardless, I am pleased with the outcome of this project.
