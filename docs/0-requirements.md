# Project Requirements

## Identified Problem or Need

My Brother Tracks his workouts through an old notebook he keeps in his drawer. he no longer wants to use the note book and rather track it on hs phone.


## End-User Requirements

My project will have a variety of end users, so they will all have a variety of tech know-how, meaning some may not be confident on technology, so my website must be easy to understand and have a clear path to each feature.


## Proposed Solution

My solution to this problem will be to create a website avaliable to use on the end-users phone which will track all of their progress separately while they can all use the same exercises.

# Relevant Implications

## Functionality

The functionality implications of a digital technology or digital outcome relate to how well it works for the end-user, in terms of meeting its intended purpose.

### Relevance to the System

Functionality is relevant to my project as it is vital that the sytems functions correctly to provide a positive user experience.

### Impact / Considerations

Moving forward I will need to constantly test my system, to ensure there are no bugs or errors in the website, I will also need to continue getting feedback from my end-user to ensure the system works the way they expect it to, if the site fails to function properly like crashing or having an error, users may become frustrated and lose trust in it.




## Usability

The usability implications of a digital technology or digital outcome (e.g. a website) relate to how easy it is to use for the end-user, without the need for help or guidance.

### Relevance to the System

Usability is relevant to my project as it is important for the users to eb albe to complete any tasks in the site easily.

### Impact / Considerations

Moving forward I will need to ensure my website follows the common usability heuristics and the users need to be able to complete tasks easily, to do this I will need to ensure I Follow standard cinventions, Make the behaviour of the system logical and familiar, provide the end-user with a clear route forwards and backwards, and always make it obvious to the end-user what is happening. If the site is difficul to use and itr is not clear what the end-user might need to do, they may become frustrated with teh site, and stop using it.



## Aesthetics

The aesthetic implications of a digital technology or digital outcome (e.g. a website) relate to how it looks in terms of design.

### Relevance to the System

The aesthetics of the site are very important as the site needs to appeal to the end-users, and be correctly designed.

### Impact / Considerations

Replace this text with an explanation of what you will need to consider moving forward and how the project will be impacted by this implication.

Moving forward I will need to ensure my design appeals to the end-users by contantky getting feedback from my end-user, I also need to ensure I follow conventions and that I correctly use colour, font and positioning.



## Accessibility

The accessibility implications of a digital technology or digital outcome (e.g. a website) involve ensuring it is available to, and can be used by, all end-users, regardless of their abilities.

### Relevance to the System

Accessibility is relevant to my project as the possible end-users of my project can come many many difeerent backgrounds and be of various ages, meaning some will have more difficulty with technology than others.

### Impact / Considerations

Moving forward I will need to constant get feedback from my end-user, ensuring the site is easy to maneovoure for all possible end-users, I will need to ensure I choose good colour combinatiosn whoch work well with the text and icons, make sure I provide appropriate structure to aid in the end-users understanding the content, and I will need to enure the site is accessible on a range of devices and browsers.



## End-User

The end-user implications of a digital technology or digital outcome (e.g. a website) are connected to the specific needs of the end-user(s).

### Relevance to the System

The end-user implications are relevant to my project as I am aiming to appeal to a specific group, people who go to the gym regularly.

### Impact / Considerations

Moving forward I will need to ensure that I meet all possible end-users specific needs, that my site appeals to gym goers, and that it works on the kind of devices they will be using. To do thsi I will need to get in contact with my end-user to learn as much about how I will need to design the website, using appropriate language and colours.

## Privacy

The privacy implications of a digital technology or digital outcome (e.g. a website) relate to protecting the privacy of end-users and their data.

### Relevance to the System

The privacy implications are important for my project as it will be storing end user data and that data will be needed for the system to function

### Impact / Considerations

Replace this text with an explanation of what you will need to consider moving forward and how the project will be impacted by this implication.
Moving forward I will need to ensure that i only collect needed data, and that that data will only only be stored if the system will need to use it, I will also need to ensure that stored data cannot be accessed by anyone other than the user, and i will need to inform th end users about any data that is required.

# User Experience (UX) Principles

## Useful

Products and systems should be genuinely useful and fulfill a real need for a group of end-users.

### Relevance to the System

This is relevant to my product as it is important that my project is useful for the users, meaning they will use it often

### Impact / Considerations

Moving forward I need to ensure that my project fulfills all the needs of my end users, so they will use the site often, i will do this by constantly getting feedback from my end user, so they can confirm if it is useful to them.


## Usable

It is essential that products and systems should be easy to use for the intended end-user.

However good usability alone is not sufficient.

### Relevance to the System

This is relevant to my project as i am trying to apeal to one group of individuals, which is gym goers.

### Impact / Considerations

Moving forward I will need to constantly get feedback from my end-user, to ensure that the site will be designed and used as they want it to be


## Findable

Systems should be easily navigable, so end-users can find the content or functionality they need.

### Relevance to the System

This is important for my project as it will need to simple to navigate, as it will typically be used right after a workout

### Impact / Considerations

Moving forward I will need to ensure that every function of the site is clear and obvious, making it simple to use for anyone.
