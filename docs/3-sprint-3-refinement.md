## Asking are you sure when deleting workouts

When deleting workouts there is no asking 'are you sure' before it is deleted

### Changes / Improvements

My end user said they do want there to be a small pop up asking if they are sure, incase they press delete by mistake.

## Exercise list

Looking at the exercise list when on a screen larger than a phone it can seem too wide, with the titles being really far apart

### Changes / Improvements

Talking to my end-user they said they would prefer that when on the exercise list it had a set width, so it never gets too wide
