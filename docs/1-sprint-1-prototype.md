# Sprint 1 - A Working UI Prototype


## Sprint Goals

Develop a prototype that simulates the key functionality of the system, then test and refine it so that it can serve as the model for the next phase of development in Sprint 2.

[Figma](https://www.figma.com/) is used to develop the prototype.

## Initial Database Design

Replace this text with notes regarding the DB design.

### Required Data Input

Replace this text with a description of what data will be input, and where / how it will be obtained.

### Required Data Output

Replace this text with a description of the outputs for the system - what types of data will be displayed?

### Required Data Processing

Replace this text with a description of how the data will be processed to achieve the desired output(s) - any processes / formulae?

## UI 'Flow'

The first stage of prototyping was to explore how the UI might 'flow' between states, based on the required functionality.

This Figma demo shows the initial design for the UI 'flow':

**FIGMA FLOW - PLACE THE FIGMA EMBED CODE HERE - MAKE SURE IT IS SET SO THAT EVERYONE CAN ACCESS IT**

### Testing

Replace this text with notes about what you did to test the UI flow and the outcome of the testing.

### Changes / Improvements

Replace this text with notes any improvements you made as a result of the testing.

## Initial UI Prototype

The next stage of prototyping was to develop the layout for each screen of the UI.

This Figma demo shows the initial layout design for the UI:

<iframe style="border: 1px solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);" width="800" height="450" src="https://embed.figma.com/proto/5ahZ8lLNkOJlpjBCUqFbMm/Workout-Tracker-High-Quality?node-id=9-141&p=f&scaling=scale-down&content-scaling=fixed&page-id=0%3A1&starting-point-node-id=2%3A2&show-proto-sidebar=1&embed-host=share" allowfullscreen></iframe>

### Testing

I moved through the design with my end-user seeing if it all flowed well

### Changes / Improvements

My end-user said they wanted to have their favourite exercises have some kind of logo as well as the exercises that they had created.

## Refined UI Prototype

Having established the layout of the UI screens, the prototype was refined visually, in terms of colour, fonts, etc.

This Figma demo shows the UI with refinements applied:

*FIGMA REFINED PROTOTYPE - PLACE THE FIGMA EMBED CODE HERE - MAKE SURE IT IS SET SO THAT EVERYONE CAN ACCESS IT*

### Testing

Replace this text with notes about what you did to test the UI flow and the outcome of the testing.

### Changes / Improvements

Replace this text with notes any improvements you made as a result of the testing.

## Sprint Review

Replace this text with a statement about how the sprint has moved the project forward - key success point, any things that didn't go so well, etc.
