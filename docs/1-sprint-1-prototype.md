# Sprint 1 - A Working UI Prototype


## Sprint Goals

Develop a prototype that simulates the key functionality of the system, then test and refine it so that it can serve as the model for the next phase of development in Sprint 2.

[Figma](https://www.figma.com/) is used to develop the prototype.

## Initial Database Design

Replace this text with notes regarding the DB design.

### Required Data Input

Replace this text with a description of what data will be input, and where / how it will be obtained.

### Required Data Output

Replace this text with a description of the outputs for the system - what types of data will be displayed?

### Required Data Processing

Replace this text with a description of how the data will be processed to achieve the desired output(s) - any processes / formulae?

## UI 'Flow'

The first stage of prototyping was to explore how the UI might 'flow' between states, based on the required functionality.

This Figma demo shows the initial design for the UI 'flow':

### Testing

Replace this text with notes about what you did to test the UI flow and the outcome of the testing.

### Changes / Improvements

Replace this text with notes any improvements you made as a result of the testing.

## Initial UI Prototype

The next stage of prototyping was to develop the layout for each screen of the UI.

This Figma demo shows the initial layout design for the UI:

### Testing

I moved through the design with my end-user seeing if it all flowed well

### Changes / Improvements

My end-user said " yeah it looks fine but i reckon you need a way to tell which is a favourite instead of ot being on top, like put a header or something, and also I'd need a way to see which exercises are mine, also would definitelyt need a logout button, and a way to delete the exercises I own. Also change the back button to like a home symbol in the top or something. And also maybe centre the Name in the header, and add a logout button, wanna be able to log out."

- List of Favourites, Owned and Other exercises, with a small symbol and key showiing which favourites are owned
- Added delete button for exercises which are owned by the user.
- A new home symbol in the top replaces the back button in certain pages, also include the home button in the forms 
- Centred the text in the header and added a logout buttin, as well as a login button in the header on the landing page.

## Refined UI Prototype

Having established the layout of the UI screens, the prototype was refined visually, in terms of colour, fonts, etc.

This Figma demo shows the UI with refinements applied:

### Testing

Replace this text with notes about what you did to test the UI flow and the outcome of the testing.

### Changes / Improvements

Replace this text with notes any improvements you made as a result of the testing.

## Sprint Review

Replace this text with a statement about how the sprint has moved the project forward - key success point, any things that didn't go so well, etc.
